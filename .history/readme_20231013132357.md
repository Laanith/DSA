### Hi, I am Laanith.

#### I initialised this repository to increase my familiarity with DSA and github



##### With every problem I will solve on LeetCode(called as LC from here on) or Interview Bit(called as IB from here on) I will push it in appropriate folder

##### The naming style of each cpp file will be ProblemName_Platform.cpp
Eg : TwoSum_IB.cpp etc...


##### I am also adding GFG_problem_of_the_day in the form of Date_GFG.cpp
Eg : Oct102023_GFG.cpp

##### Each folder will also have 3 subfolders marking easy, medium and hard problems 

##### In each folder, I will try to make my custom data structure too and will upload the code. This will improve my implementation fundamentals..
